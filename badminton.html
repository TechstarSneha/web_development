    <h4> I love to play badminton. In my childhood, I really did't knew how to play badminton
         and thus no one used to play with me just because I was a noob.
         
        But later in my 6th class I joined badminton classes. 
    
        But the fact is I did it just for one month, it isn't the thing that I was not 
        interested but there was no one 
        to drop me at the place and my parents didn't allowed me 
        to go alone so I had to give up going to classes.
         Also in the classes more focus was on physical workout 
        and very less playing practice.
         So at last I wasn't able to be good at it.
        
        Later I used to play with the children in my locality and slowly developed as a good badminton player.
        
        After I was a good enough player, I played badminton at regional level at navodaya.
        
        Looking behnid, I realize that it was a great journey.
        
        These days I play badminton with my friends at gymkhana courts in IIT.
