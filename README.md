# web_development
As the part of the SOC, I'm learning web development and thus I covered a lot of things under this topic and also gained hands-on-experience. I'm really glad that I've reached this far. I'm sharing some of my basic codes that I've applied in the assignmemts. 

1. The Assignment 0 was the 1st ever assigment I received in web development where I've applied the knowledge of ordered and unordered lists. The code of the assignment 0 is contained in 1.html file.
   
2. The assignment 1 was about making our own website which includes our information, hobbies, hyperlink to hobbies that takes to other pages where we would explain our hobbies in detail and also some more things by using just html(we didn't knew css or js). All the codes for the assignment 1 are contained in the homepage.html, singing.html, sketching.html, travellig.html, badminton.html.

3. The assignment 2 was about making a webpage , a flag and related to flexbox. I've applied my knowledge of positioning, and flexbox and also some additional features to make the assignment look better. The codes are contained in Q1.html, Q2.html, Q3.html.

4. I've received the assignment 3 but it is not completed yet so I'm not uploading it.
